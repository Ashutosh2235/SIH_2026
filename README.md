# SecureMailScope

**Passive email transport-security analysis from packet captures.**

Give SecureMailScope a `.pcap` or `.pcapng` — plain, or still compressed as `.gz`, `.bz2`, `.xz` or `.zst` — and it reconstructs every SMTP, IMAP and POP3
conversation in it, then answers the questions a mail-security analyst actually has:

- Was TLS used at all, or did mail and passwords cross the network in cleartext?
- Was the STARTTLS upgrade **stripped** by someone in the path, or were commands
  **injected** around it?
- How strong was the TLS that was negotiated: protocol version, cipher suite, key exchange, certificate?
- Does this session look like the endpoint's normal behaviour, or is it a **possible active MITM**?

It produces a ranked findings list, each finding with its evidence, a Postfix/Dovecot fix and
a compliance mapping. It also gives a 0–100 posture score and a self-contained HTML dashboard,
plus JSON for a SIEM and an optional PDF.

It is **passive**: it never touches the network, so it can run anywhere a capture can be copied,
including an air-gapped forensic workstation. It is also **metadata-only**: passwords, tokens and
message bodies are never stored.

## Quick start

Requires Python 3.11+.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Generate the demo captures (real TCP/TLS bytes, a demo CA, every weakness class):

```bash
python -m securemailscope samples samples
```

Teach it what "normal" looks like from a clean week, then analyse the demo capture against that baseline:

```bash
python -m securemailscope analyze samples/healthy_baseline.pcap --trust-store samples/demo-ca.pem --baseline-db baseline.sqlite -o reports
```

```bash
python -m securemailscope analyze samples/demo_enterprise.pcap --trust-store samples/demo-ca.pem --baseline-db baseline.sqlite -o reports -f html,json,pdf
```

Open `reports/demo_enterprise.html` in a browser. Run the tests:

```bash
python -m pytest -q
```

Or use the web UI:

```bash
python -m securemailscope serve --trust-store samples/demo-ca.pem
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8000 and either drop in a capture or click **Run the built-in demo capture**. The frontend shows:

- **Animated analysis**: the pipeline stages light up while the capture is analysed, then show their real timings.
- **Wire replay**: the whole capture plays back as live traffic. Clients are on the left and servers on the right. Links seal mint when TLS comes up, turn orange when the session stays cleartext, and turn red with an interceptor marker when a session was stripped, injected, had its certificate swapped or was downgraded. A feed of findings builds up as sessions complete.
- **Handshake replay**: click any session to step through it as a sequence diagram. You see TCP, the SMTP/IMAP/POP3 dialogue, STARTTLS, and ClientHello → ServerHello → Certificate → Finished. A stripped offer visibly turns `STARTTLS` into `XXXXXXXX` at the network path, and each finding lights up at the step that triggers it. Use play, pause, step, speed and the scrubber, or ← → and the space bar.

Or use Docker (one container with the web UI on port 8000 and the samples built in):

```bash
docker build -t securemailscope . && docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 securemailscope
```

> The first analysis in a fresh environment trains the bootstrap risk model (a few seconds) and
> caches it under `~/.cache/securemailscope`. On Windows, importing scikit-learn can itself take
> around 10 s the first time. The analysis stages take well under a second for the demo capture.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `analyze CAPTURE... [-o DIR] [-f html,json,pdf]` | Run the full pipeline and write reports plus `audit.log` |
| `  --trust-store PEM` | Trusted roots, e.g. your private CA (default: certifi's Mozilla bundle) |
| `  --baseline-db FILE` | SQLite memory of endpoint behaviour across captures |
| `  --no-learn` | Compare against the baseline without updating it |
| `  --assets JSON` | Asset criticality weights, e.g. `{"203.0.113.11:587": 1.5}` |
| `  --no-ml`, `--contamination X` | Rules and baseline only; isolation-forest contamination override |
| `  --fail-on SEVERITY` | Exit code 2 if any finding is at least this severe (for CI and cron) |
| `samples [DIR]` | Write the demo captures and the demo CA |
| `baseline --db FILE` | Show the learned endpoint profiles |
| `train` | Rebuild the bootstrap risk model and print its hold-out metrics |
| `serve [--port 8000]` | Web UI and `POST /api/analyze` JSON API |

## What it detects

| Class | Examples | Rules |
|---|---|---|
| STARTTLS stripping | capability rewritten to `XXXXXXXX`, `454 TLS not available`, upgrade accepted but no TLS | `SMS-STRIP-001` |
| STARTTLS injection | cleartext pipelined after `STARTTLS` (client) or after `220 Ready` (server) | `SMS-INJ-001` |
| Cleartext exposure | `AUTH LOGIN`/`PLAIN`, IMAP `LOGIN`, POP3 `USER/PASS`, message bodies | `SMS-CRED-*`, `SMS-DATA-001`, `SMS-PLAIN-*` |
| Protocol / cipher | SSLv3–TLS 1.1, RC4/3DES/EXPORT/NULL/anon, no forward secrecy, CBC, DH < 2048, compression, downgrade sentinel | `SMS-TLS-*` |
| Certificates | expired, self-signed, wildcard/hostname mismatch, RSA < 2048, SHA-1, broken chain, untrusted | `SMS-CERT-*` |
| Endpoint baseline | STARTTLS vanished, certificate changed, version/cipher downgrade, new JA3S | `SMS-BASE-*` |
| Statistical outlier | isolation forest over session feature vectors | `SMS-ML-001` |

The full catalogue, with triggers, fixes and compliance references, is in [docs/07-rules-catalog.md](docs/07-rules-catalog.md).

## Status and limits

- Tested: 91 automated tests. The whole pipeline runs on generated PCAP and PCAPNG captures
  (Ethernet, 802.1Q, Linux SLL, IPv6, sequence wrap, retransmission, reordering).
- The Docker lab in `lab/` is written, but it was not run in this environment because the
  Docker daemon wasn't running. Its stripping proxy logic is unit-tested.
- Passive analysis cannot see certificates inside TLS 1.3, check revocation, or reassemble
  IP fragments. Each of these is reported as "unknown", never as "fine". See [docs/01-overview.md](docs/01-overview.md#limits).
