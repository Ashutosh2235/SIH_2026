"""Stage 07: deterministic weakness rules -> Finding objects.

Every finding carries evidence (what was seen), a configuration-level fix
(Postfix / Dovecot) and an indicative compliance mapping. Severities here are
*intrinsic*; Part 3 later turns them into priorities using exposure,
exploitability, asset criticality and the per-endpoint baseline.
